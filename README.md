*Muse

** Muse generates a random Action and Theme to spark imagination and ideas.

*** The concept is simple, but the limitations are endless. Think of something... anything... then generate an Action and Theme. Apply the Action and Theme to what you were thinking about. This may take abastraction, but they also may fit right into place. Over time, practicing this technique will allow you to think more outside the box.
